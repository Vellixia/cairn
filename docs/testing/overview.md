# Cairn End-to-End Testing

> **Note:** This document records test results from v0.5.0-v0.7.1. CLI commands like
> `cairn pair`, `cairn sync`, `cairn export`, `cairn import`, `cairn contribute`,
> `cairn pull`, and `cairn bench` have been removed in v0.6.4. The equivalent
> functionality is now available via MCP tools (for AI agents) or the dashboard
> (for humans). See `AGENTS.md` for the current CLI command set.

## Two test layers

Cairn v0.7.1 ships two complementary test buckets. Both are **local-only and AI-verified**;
the CI does not run either. Every Rust test exercises a real Cairn crate against a real
`Store::open_in_memory()` instance; every dashboard flow is driven by an AI agent using the
`chrome-devtools` MCP server against the live dashboard.

### 1. Rust integration tests - `crates/cairn-tests/`

A workspace member hosting 17 hermetic integration test files under
`crates/cairn-tests/tests/<NN>_<topic>.rs`. Each file is a separate `cargo test` binary,
all run by `cargo test -p cairn-tests` (or `cargo test --workspace`). Tests use **no
network and no live HelixDB** - they construct a real `cairn_store::Store` backed by a
new in-memory `MemoryBackend` (added in 0.7.1) and exercise every engine.

```sh
cargo test -p cairn-tests                       # all 17 files, 134 tests
cargo test -p cairn-tests --test 19_memory_engine     # one
```

Coverage (17 files, 134 tests):

| # | File | Real crate surface |
|---|------|-------------------|
| 01 | `01_memory_tiers.rs` | `cairn_memory` followup/gotcha trackers, `analysis::{activity_heatmap, generate_architecture_report}`, `serde` round-trip for `NewMemory` |
| 04 | `04_rerank.rs` | `cairn_rerank::{NullReranker, from_config}` + end-to-end `MemoryEngine::hybrid_search_with_rerank` over the in-memory store |
| 05 | `05_guardrails.rs` | `cairn_guard::Guard::{verify_edit, set_anchor, anchor}` against the in-memory store (clean / large-deletion / suspicious-anchor paths) |
| 06 | `06_shell_profiles.rs` | `cairn_shell::{compress_output, find_match, REGISTRY}` |
| 07 | `07_share.rs` | `cairn_share::Sanitizer` (all secret kinds, sensitivity, idempotence) |
| 08 | `08_pack_registry.rs` | `cairn_pack` Ed25519 sign/verify, `cairn_registry::TrustScope` |
| 09 | `09_session.rs` | `cairn_session::SessionStore` save/load + drift append/approve + `latest_id` |
| 10 | `10_sync_crypto.rs` | `cairn_sync::{GCounter, ORSet, VectorClock}` + `cairn_sync::crypto::{encrypt_envelope, decrypt_envelope}` round-trip |
| 12 | `12_proactive.rs` | `cairn_proactive::intent::classify` (recall cues, file paths, suppression) |
| 13 | `13_ingest.rs` | `cairn_ingest::{parse_vtt, parse_srt, parse_json, chunk_by_speaker_and_window}` |
| 16 | `16_config.rs` | `Config::resolve(None)` env-driven, `OrgId` validation, `RerankConfig` redacted Debug |
| 17 | `17_workspace_invariants.rs` | workspace member list, tilde constraints, hermetic-deps rule |
| 18 | `18_context_engine.rs` | real `cairn_context::ContextEngine` over `Store::open_in_memory` - Full / Cached / Diff / Outline / anti-inflation / auto-delta |
| 19 | `19_memory_engine.rs` | real `cairn_memory::MemoryEngine` - remember dedup, recall ranking, hybrid_search, gotcha promotion, crystallize, consolidate |
| 20 | `20_assembler.rs` | real `cairn_assemble::Assembler::assemble` - budget enforcement, dropped items, JSON shape |
| 22 | `22_mcp_dispatch.rs` | real `cairn_mcp::McpServer::dispatch` - tool list, remember/recall round-trip, assemble, sanitize, unknown-tool error |
| 23 | `23_api_envelope.rs` | real `cairn_api::router` mounted via `tower::ServiceExt::oneshot` - /api/health, /api/capabilities, /api/openapi.json, /api/stats (auth-gated), 404 envelope |

**Hermetic boundary:** the test bucket never talks to HelixDB. `Store::open_in_memory()`
constructs a fully in-memory `Store` whose every operation matches the Helix backend's
semantics (last-write-wins on `upsert_memory`, monotonic audit ids, single-use pairing codes,
`__deleted__` tombstone honoring). `semantic_recall` returns `Ok(None)` so
`MemoryEngine` falls back to lexical ranking, identical to the offline behaviour of the
production server when `CAIRN_HELIX_URL` is unset.

**Bugs surfaced by this bucket in 0.7.1:**
- `crates/cairn-memory/src/gotcha_tracker.rs:122` and `followup_tracker.rs:56` panic on
  freshly-booted systems (`Instant::now() - window` overflow when `window` exceeds system
  uptime). Fixed in 0.7.1 via `checked_sub`. See
  `docs/testing/findings/tracker-overflow-on-fresh-boot.md`.

Add a new flow by dropping a `tests/<NN>_<topic>.rs` file - cargo discovers it. Tests must
exercise a real Cairn crate API; hand-coded JSON literals and re-implementations of
functions already in the crate are explicitly rejected (the previous 0.7.0 bucket had
several such tautological tests; they were deleted).

### 2. Web dashboard flow tests - `web/test/`

The dashboard is driven by an AI agent using the `chrome-devtools` MCP server. No
PowerShell, no agent-browser, no scripted assertions. The agent drives Chrome and asserts
on real DOM state via accessibility snapshots + console messages.

Read `docs/testing/flows.md` for the 13 flow checklists (login, recall, anchor, compression,
tokens, audit, palette, etc.). Read `docs/testing/run-agent-tests.md` for the meta-instruction
that drives the AI agent.

When a flow fails for a real-product reason (a TypeError, a 404, a JSON parse error), write
a finding to `docs/testing/findings/<slug>.md` using the template in `flows.md`. The findings
folder is the durable artifact - bugs surface here, they are never silently fixed.
Screenshots land in `web/test/screenshots/<NN>-<flow>/*.png`; the run summary in
`docs/testing/findings/SUMMARY.md`.

The 13 flows cover: login + overview, recall, wakeup + graph, anchor + drift, registry
trust + packs, architecture + heatmap, compression lab, token issue/revoke, sessions +
audit, assemble budget, PWA shell, command palette, and the error-envelope contract.

**Findings from the 0.7.1 run:**
- `tracker-overflow-on-fresh-boot.md` - production panic in `GotchaTracker` /
  `FollowupTracker` (also surfaced in the Rust bucket).
- `no-trust-anchor-route.md` - `/trust/anchor` does not exist; anchor widget is on `/`.
- `registry-page-crash.md` - `/registry` client-side TypeError on `.title`.
- `architecture-page-crash.md` - `/memory/architecture` client-side TypeError on `.title`.
- `heatmap-page-crash.md` - `/memory/heatmap` client-side TypeError on `.title`.
- `no-assemble-route.md` - no UI for the assemble budget API.
- `mobile-pack-installs-json-error.md` - `/mobile` shows `SyntaxError: Unexpected token
  '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON` for RECENT PACK INSTALLS.
- `command-palette-needs-ctrl-k.md` - bare `K` does not open the palette; `Ctrl+K` does.

These are real product bugs. They are surfaced as findings, not fixed in 0.7.1 (a
follow-up branch will repair them).

**Hard rules (enforced via the `chrome-devtools` MCP):**
- A step that times out, returns no snapshot, or returns an identical-looking screenshot
  to the previous step is a **failure**. Write a finding. Never "PASS" the flow.
- **No fake passes.** If you can't confirm, write a finding.

## Historical context (pre-v0.7.0)

Live testing of every Cairn use case through OpenCode MCP, direct MCP stdio, and the CLI.
Tests run against the Docker-backed Cairn server (`http://localhost:7777`).

**Test method**: Direct JSON-RPC over `cairn mcp` stdio (fast, no AI model hang-ups)
for tool tests. HTTP `Invoke-RestMethod` for API tests. CLI commands for setup/bench/sync.

For the 0.5.0 release we also ship a **PowerShell scenario harness** at
`scripts/e2e.ps1` covering 20 flows (memory, context, guardrails, sessions, sync,
federation, registry, ingest, proactive, mobile companion). 67/69 assertions pass against
a fresh `docker compose up`. See `docs/testing/e2e.md` for the full list.

For v0.7.0 we also ship the **agent-browser PowerShell harness** that the 0.7.1
chrome-devtools flow layer replaced. The agent-browser harness produced 13/13 "PASS" but
its assertions were URL-pattern only, so it missed the `/memory/architecture` and
`/mobile` crashes. Replaced because the chrome-devtools version is AI-driven and asserts
on real DOM state, not URL string matches.

## Infrastructure

| Component | Status |
|---|---|
| Docker stack (cairn + helix + minio) | Running |
| Cairn server | `http://localhost:7777` (HTTP, `CAIRN_INSECURE=1`) |
| Device token | `opencode-test` (write scope) |

## Summary

The v0.5.0 release runs **20 e2e scenarios** (`scripts/e2e/01-*.ps1` ...
`20-*.ps1`, ~67 assertions, 67/69 pass) against a fresh `docker compose up`.
`cargo test --workspace` reports **330 passed + 5 ignored** for the unit
and integration suite. Both are the single source of truth for release
readiness; see `docs/testing/e2e.md` for the scenario list and `docs/planning/roadmap.md`
for the live numbers.

## Notes

- **Admin token for pool operations**: `/api/pool/contribute` requires an admin-scoped device token. Regular `write` tokens work for all personal memory/context/profile APIs.
- **Secret key consistency**: Device tokens are signed with `CAIRN_SECRET_KEY`. A token minted by one server/CLI instance is only accepted by another if they share the same secret. For Docker testing, either use the same `.env` key everywhere or create tokens inside the container.
- **Recall loose matches**: With the default `hashing` embed provider, `recall` is lexical/BM25-driven and may return similar-sounding results for nonsense queries. Switch to a semantic embed provider for stricter semantic matching.
