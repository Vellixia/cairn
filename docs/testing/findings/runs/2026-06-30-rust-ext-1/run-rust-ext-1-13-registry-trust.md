# /registry/trust - Run rust-ext-1 step 13

## Expected
Trusted Keys page renders the Trusted Keys panel with Add Key button and empty state.

## Observed
- URL: http://127.0.0.1:7777/registry/trust?cb=run-rust-ext-1-13b (also tested bare /registry/trust - both render)
- HTTP status: 200
- Page title: Cairn --- dashboard
- Main content: heading "Pack registry", nav (Packs/Trusted Keys/Revocations), "Trusted Keys" panel, Add Key button, empty state "No trusted keys configured."
- Console errors: 0
- Console warnings: 0
- A11y snapshot excerpt: heading "Pack registry" level=1; nav with 3 tabs; Add Key button; empty state

## Verdict
PASS

## Notes
Direct nav (with or without ?cb= query) renders correctly. The RSC prefetch TypeError from the parent hub's prefetcher (BUG 10-4 style) is documented in step 11. The previously-known BUG 11-1 was reported via command palette navigation; bare-URL direct nav appears healthy in this run.
