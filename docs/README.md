# Cairn Documentation Library

This is the catalog of every doc in this repo. If you're new, start with the root
[README.md](../README.md) (for users) or [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) (for AI agents) — they
route you here for anything deeper.

Writing a new doc? Read [CONVENTIONS.md](CONVENTIONS.md) first — it explains where things go
and which template to use.
