## Phase 3 - Collective + Federation + Depth

### Done

| Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `cairn-share`: export/import sanitized bundles | Done | Redacts PII, withholds hard secrets |
| `cairn-share`: pool contribute/pull | Done | Federated sanitized knowledge (admin-scoped token required) |
| Health checks in Docker Compose | Done | minio/helix/cairn all `service_healthy`; `depends_on: service_healthy`; minio-init bounded retry |
| CI smoke test (compose + API) | Done | `ci-smoke` job asserted `{"tools":[...]}` envelope + 5 tools. **Superseded** by the 54-test live suite (see `docs/testing/overview.md`); removed from CI. |
| Single admin account + cookie session (0.4.0) | Done | Argon2id hash, httpOnly HMAC-SHA256 cookie, sliding TTL, generation counter for instant invalidation |
| Admin recovery: `cairn-server admin password` + `reset` | Done | Loopback-only, mirrors the TLS gate; resets write a tombstone (HelixDB append-only schema) |
| Web: sidebar dashboard + login + setup wizard | Done | SessionGate probes `/api/auth/status` + `/me`; `aria-current` sidebar, K palette, toast system |
| Admin token issuance from the dashboard | Done | `/api/devices/{tokens, pair-codes, audit}` admin endpoints; CLI flow unchanged |
| Security headers middleware | Done | `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`, `Permissions-Policy: clipboard-write=(self)` |

### In progress / partial

| Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Full 4-tier consolidation/decay | Partial | Consolidation implemented, decay tuning ongoing |
| Hybrid search (BM25 + vector + graph, RRF) | Partial | BM25 done, HNSW vectors via HelixDB, **graph leg next** |
| Federation (signed packs, trust/scopes) | Partial | Share/pool exists, full federation protocol TBD |

### Backlog

| Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Property graph + impact analysis | Not started | Feeds the graph leg of hybrid search; planned as `cairn-graph` or in `cairn-context` |
| Rerank + MMR diversity | Not started | Post-retrieval quality improvements; high-leverage, small change |
| Offline-first sync (automerge CRDT) | Not started | Currently last-write-wins |
| E2E encryption for sync | Not started | Optional, for privacy-sensitive setups |
| Collective voting/provenance/decay | Not started | Community governance for shared knowledge |

### Hardening & DX (audit-driven)

| Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Slim default Docker image; `embed-local` opt-in | Done | Default `CAIRN_FEATURES=""`; opt back in with `--build-arg CAIRN_FEATURES=embed-local`. Closes audit M-12. |
| Local model SHA-256 verification | Done | `CAIRN_EMBED_FASTEMBED_SHA256` pin; constant-time compare; logs actual hash at WARN when no pin set. Closes audit M-9. |

---

## Phase 4 - Distribution

The product is feature-complete enough to install and use. The remaining work is **getting it onto every machine people use** - distribution channels, install paths, and the benchmarks that turn the engineering into marketing.

| Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| OpenCode README quickstart | Done | New "OpenCode quickstart" section in README |
| Multi-platform release binaries | Not started | `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`, `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`, `x86_64-apple-darwin`, `aarch64-apple-darwin`, `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`, `aarch64-pc-windows-msvc`; upload + `SHA256SUMS` per release |
| Non-root Docker volume init | Done | New `cairn-init` one-shot chowns `/data` to uid 10001, verifies with `stat`, fails fast on host-bind misconfig. cairn service runs as `user: "10001:10001"` - verified live (`uid=10001(cairn)`) |
| LongMemEval / LoCoMo benchmarks | Not started | Standard recall benchmarks; publish numbers in `docs/testing/benchmarks.md` |
| Task-success lift at increasing horizons | Not started | Synthetic drift benchmark; cite the architecture justification in `docs/reference/vision.md` |
