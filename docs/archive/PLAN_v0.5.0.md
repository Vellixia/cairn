## Â§0. North Star

**Goal:** make any AI agent have smart memory â€” across sessions, devices, projects, and time â€”
without losing a single byte and without burning context budget.

**Why v0.5.0 specifically:** the v0.4.0 web dashboard is shipped and dogfooded. The hard parts
of "ingest, compress, retrieve, assemble, verify" are done. What remains is making memory
**smart** â€” not just stored â€” and exposing it through a UX that earns the daily-driver slot
in a developer's workflow.

**Three sentences on what "smart" means here:**
1. **Memory that thinks for itself** â€” confidence scoring, provenance edges, contradiction
   detection, tier promotion, decay, and crystallization happen automatically.
2. **Memory you can see and shape** â€” every memory is editable, pinnable, promotable, and
   deletable from a dashboard that visualizes the memory graph as a first-class artifact.
3. **Memory that survives everything** â€” compaction, drift, crashes, devices, projects, and
   time. The original is always one `expand` away, the signed ledger proves it.

---

## Â§1. The Six Dimensions of Smart Memory

Cairn's value isn't any single feature â€” it's the integration. The six dimensions below are
how we measure "smart," and where each lives in the codebase.

### 1.1 Continuity â€” memory survives across sessions and devices

| Where today | Where v0.5.0 |
|---|---|
| `cairn-memory` 4-tier (working â†’ episodic â†’ semantic â†’ procedural) | Same; add Cross-Session Protocol (CCP) auto-restore |
| `cairn-share` export/import for offline move | Same |
| Multi-device sync (LWW on `updated_at`) | Add session concept: `sessions/<id>.json` with tasks/findings/decisions/touched_files/next_steps |
| `SessionStart` hook injects anchor + profile + memories | Inject CCP block too (auto, ~400 tokens) |

**Credit:** Cross-Session Protocol pattern adopted from **lean-ctx** (`docs/reference/03-memory-and-knowledge.md` Â§1).

### 1.2 Scope â€” memory knows where it belongs

| Where today | Where v0.5.0 |
|---|---|
| Implicit project scoping via HelixDB key prefixes | Explicit `project_hash` field on every memory (lean-ctx `knowledge/<project-hash>` pattern) |
| `importance: f32` set at remember-time | Add `confidence: f32` that evolves with reinforcement and decay |
| No confidence surface in UI | Confidence bar in Wakeup/Recall/Memory Graph, sort/filter by min confidence |
| No universal gotchas | Universal gotchas (`knowledge/universal-gotchas.json` idea) for cross-project footguns |

**Credit:** Confidence scoring + reinforcement adopted from **agentmemory** (`src/functions/lessons.ts`).

### 1.3 Recall â€” memory retrieves the right thing at the right time

| Where today | Where v0.5.0 |
|---|---|
| BM25 lexical recall + 4-tier wakeup + Ebbinghaus decay | Finish hybrid search RRF: BM25 + HNSW vectors + graph leg |
| HNSW via HelixDB (partial) | Graph-proximity boost for recently touched files and memory nodes |
| No rerank | Add rerank + MMR diversity (post-retrieval) |
| No semantic search CLI | Add `cairn search` CLI + `/api/search` hybrid endpoint |

**Credit:** RRF formula and hybrid search fusion adopted from **lean-ctx** (`LEANCTX_FEATURE_CATALOG.md` Â§Hybrid Search Fusion).

### 1.4 Reliability â€” memory can be verified and recovered

| Where today | Where v0.5.0 |
|---|---|
| `cairn-guard`: verify, anchor, checkpoint, rollback, reliability score | Persist `verify` results into HelixDB drift log |
| `verify` flags large unreplaced deletions | Reliability center: list drift events, approve/reject flagged edits |
| Audit log is in-memory only | Move audit to HelixDB-backed store (restart-safe) |
| Reliability score visible in UI | Drift events detail view linked to affected file/memory |

### 1.5 Compression â€” memory shrinks the window without losing fidelity

| Where today | Where v0.5.0 |
|---|---|
| 4 read modes, ~13-tok re-reads, tree-sitter AST, shell compression | This is Cairn's strongest dimension â€” keep and polish |
| `cairn bench` measures a codebase | Live `/api/metrics` + savings dashboard: cumulative tokens/$ saved, hit rate, bounce rate |
| No signed ledger | Signed JSON ledger of every compression/recover event |

### 1.6 Personalization â€” memory learns the user

| Where today | Where v0.5.0 |
|---|---|
| `cairn-profile`: `prefer`/`profile` auto-learned from prompts | Profile editor: view / approve / edit / delete preferences + do/don't rules |
| Preferences injected at session start | Same, but with explicit confidence + user override flag |
| No UI for preferences | New `/dashboard/profile` page + profile chip in topbar |

---

## Â§2. The Eight Big Ideas

These are the concrete initiatives that turn the six dimensions into shipped features.

### 2.1 Memory Provenance Graph â€” Cairn's integration moat

**What it is:** every memory gets a set of typed edges to other memories and to code artifacts.

- `memory â†’ derived_from â†’ memory` â€” a crystallized lesson came from action A and B
- `memory â†’ contradicts â†’ memory` â€” two memories conflict; needs user resolution
- `memory â†’ supersedes â†’ memory` â€” a newer memory replaces an older one
- `memory â†’ applies_to â†’ file|symbol|project` â€” lean-ctx-style graph relevance for code

**Why it matters:** lean-ctx has code graphs, agentmemory has session graphs, Cairn can have
**memory provenance graphs**. This is the unique integration moat: a single graph where code,
sessions, and knowledge connect.

**Where stored:** HelixDB native graph edges.

**Surfaced in:** Memory Graph Visualization (Idea 8) + Wakeup "related memories" hints.

### 2.2 Memory Graph Visualization â€” the demo video moment

**What it is:** a force-directed, interactive graph in the web dashboard where:

- Nodes = memories, sized by `confidence`, colored by `tier`
- Edges = `derived_from` / `contradicts` / `supersedes` / `applies_to`
- Clicking a node opens the memory detail panel with edit/promote/delete
- Filtering by tier, kind, project, confidence range
- "What does the agent know about X?" â†’ subgraph centered on a query

**Library choice:** `react-force-graph-2d` (clean API, d3-force underneath, ~50KB). The
dashboard is Next.js static-export; react-force-graph-2d works with `ssr: false`.

**New route:** `/dashboard/memory/graph`.

### 2.3 Confidence + Reinforcement Loop â€” adopted from agentmemory

**What it is:** every memory gets a `confidence: f32` field.

- On each successful `recall` hit, `confidence = min(1.0, confidence + 0.1 * (1.0 - confidence))`
  (agentmemory's proven reinforcement curve).
- On consolidation, confidence decays by a rate inversely proportional to `importance`.
- When `confidence` falls below a threshold (default 0.1) and the memory has zero
  reinforcements, it is marked for review or deletion.

**Where:** `cairn-memory` schema + `recall` path + `consolidate` path.

**Default for existing memories:** 0.5 (neutral).

### 2.4 Cross-Session Protocol (CCP) â€” adopted from lean-ctx

**What it is:** at session start, Cairn injects a structured "where we were" block.

- `tasks: [{ id, title, progress }]`
- `findings: [{ text, source_file, confidence }]`
- `decisions: [{ text, rationale, confidence }]`
- `touched_files: [{ path, mode, handle }]`
- `next_steps: [text]`

**Storage:** `sessions/<id>.json` with `sessions/latest.json` pointer.

**Auto-restore:** the `SessionStart` hook reads `latest.json` and injects the block.

**CLI surface:** `cairn session task|finding|decision|status|save|load|reset`, plus
`sessions list|show|cleanup|doctor`.

### 2.5 Cost-Saving Ledger â€” new for Cairn

**What it is:** every tool call that saves context budget gets a ledger entry.

- `bytes_in`, `bytes_out`, `tokens_saved`, `cost_usd_saved`
- `source`: `read-cache`, `ast-signatures`, `shell-compress`, `wakeup`, `assemble`
- Cumulative per project, per device, per user

**Where:** `/api/ledger`, `/api/metrics`, dashboard "Savings & Recover" page.

**Signed:** SHA-256 HMAC per entry, verifiable offline.

### 2.6 Project-Aware Memory Hygiene â€” new for Cairn

**What it is:** tooling to keep memory from growing stale or contradictory.

- `cairn doctor memory` â€” counts by tier, importance distribution, decay schedule,
  contradiction count, graph density
- `cairn memory prune --dry-run` â€” preview consolidation removals
- `cairn memory crystallize` â€” summarize a completed session's working-tier memories into
  semantic-tier "crystals" (agentmemory's pattern)
- Web UI: Memory Workspace with bulk select + promote/delete/pin

### 2.7 Federation as First-Class â€” extends cairn-share

**What it is:** today `cairn share export` makes a sanitized bundle and `contribute`/`pull`
pools it. v0.5.0 turns this into a discoverable, signed package system.

- `.cairnpkg` file format: manifest.json + knowledge.jsonl + graph.sqlite + session.json +
  patterns.json + gotchas.json + signature.sha256
- Adopt the lean-ctx `.ctxpkg` design (SHA-256 integrity, atomic writes, knowledge merge with
  confidence capping, graph overlay, auto-load) as the **primary `.cairnpkg` format**. The
  `.ctxpkg` extension is recognized as an import alias for interoperability.
- CLI: `cairn pack create|list|info|install|remove|export|import|auto-load|publish|search`
- Registry: embedded in `cairn-server` for self-hosting; optional separate `cairn.sh/registry`
  service only if public traffic justifies it
- Web UI: Collective / Federation manager

**Decision:** `.cairnpkg` is the canonical extension; `.ctxpkg` imports are accepted. The
registry starts embedded in `cairn-server`.

### 2.8 SSE Real-Time Dashboard â€” simpler than WebSocket

**What it is:** replace 5s polling on Overview and Audit with Server-Sent Events.

- `GET /api/events` returns `text/event-stream`
- Event types: `stats_updated`, `memory_added`, `checkpoint_created`, `audit_event`, `drift_detected`
- Frontend uses native `EventSource` with reconnection
- This is one-way from server to browser â€” simpler than WebSocket, no upgrade dance

**Where:** `cairn-api` axum SSE endpoint + `web/src/lib/sse.ts` + React Query integration.

## Â§6. Design Decisions

The following decisions are locked for v0.5.0:

| Decision | Resolution | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Confidence field adopts agentmemory's reinforcement curve** | Locked | Proven, easy to implement, intuitive |
| **Memory graph edges use HelixDB native graph** | Locked | Graph-native queries, no secondary store |
| **Cross-Session Protocol adopts lean-ctx pattern** | Locked | Battle-tested, compact (~400 tokens), auto-restore works |
| **Context Package System adopts lean-ctx `.ctxpkg` design** | `.cairnpkg` canonical; `.ctxpkg` accepted as import alias | Free interop/ecosystem trust; distinct Cairn identity |
| **SSE instead of WebSocket for dashboard** | Locked | One-way is enough; simpler; native EventSource |
| **Memory Graph Visualization uses `react-force-graph-2d`** | Locked | Clean API, d3-force, works with Next.js static export |
| **Setup wizard v2 includes embed provider picker** | Locked; default = local hashing first | PLAN.md requirement; avoids post-install `.env` edits |
| **Audit log moves to HelixDB** | Locked | Currently lost on restart; trust-critical |
| **Savings ledger is signed** | Locked | Proves no-loss compression claim |
| **Memory graph exposed as MCP resource** | `cairn://memory/graph` plus tools | Natural complement to graph-native store |
| **Pack registry host** | Embedded in `cairn-server` via `/registry` routes | Self-hostable first; public `cairn.sh` can proxy later |
| **Phase 5 "Beyond" items** | Promoted to committed sprints in the phase map below | User wants all Phase 5 features committed to v0.5.0 |

## Â§7. Success Metrics

At the end of v0.5.0:

- **â‰¥40 MCP tools** exposed (up from 16)
- **6 MCP resources + 5 MCP prompts**
- **â‰¤500ms** SSE event latency
- **Memory Graph renders 50 nodes in <1s**
- **Confidence reinforcement visible in UI**
- **Drift events reviewable + approvable**
- **One-command install** works on Linux/macOS/Windows
- **One-click deploy** available
- **LongMemEval/LoCoMo scores published** honestly
- **No in-memory-only state** (audit, sessions, drift, ledger all durable)

---

## Â§8. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Schema migration on live HelixDB | Default `confidence = 0.5`; additive fields only; no rewrites |
| Graphviz library bloat | react-force-graph-2d is ~50KB; lazy-load on `/dashboard/memory/graph` |
| MCP tool explosion confusing users | Use dynamic tool categories (core / arch / memory / metrics / session / pack) |
| Package format interop disputes | Credit lean-ctx lineage; publish spec openly |
| Benchmark numbers not competitive | Publish methodology and honest deltas; iterate |
| Feature scope creep | Phase 5 items are now committed sprints with dedicated testing; keep scope fixed to the 23 sprints above |

| ADR-011 | Memory provenance graph stored in HelixDB native graph |
| ADR-012 | Cross-Session Protocol (lean-ctx CCP adoption) |
| ADR-013 | Context package format: `.cairnpkg` canonical, `.ctxpkg` import alias |
| ADR-014 | SSE real-time dashboard vs WebSocket |
| ADR-015 | Default embedding provider: local hashing first |
| ADR-016 | Pack registry embedded in `cairn-server` for self-hosting |

## Â§10. Resolved Open Questions

The following questions were answered before implementation begins:

1. **`.cairnpkg` vs `.ctxpkg`** â€” `.cairnpkg` is the canonical extension; `.ctxpkg` files are
   accepted as an import alias for interoperability with lean-ctx.
2. **Phase 5 items** â€” promoted to committed roadmap and mapped into the sprints below.
3. **Default embed provider** â€” local hashing first (offline-first), with optional local ONNX and
   OpenAI-compatible endpoints selectable in the setup wizard.
4. **Memory graph visibility** â€” exposed both in the web dashboard and as the MCP resource
   `cairn://memory/graph`, plus `memory_graph` and related graph tools.
5. **`cairn.sh` registry** â€” the v0.5.0 registry is embedded in `cairn-server` for self-hosting.
   A public `cairn.sh` proxy can be added later without changing the protocol.

These resolutions will be captured as ADRs in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

*This plan is a living document. As implementation starts, each sprint will produce or update
SPEC.md tasks, and the resolutions above will be mirrored into DECISIONS.md ADRs.*
