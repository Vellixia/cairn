# Cairn End-to-End Testing

Live testing of every Cairn use case through OpenCode MCP, direct MCP stdio, and the CLI.
Tests run against the Docker-backed Cairn server (`http://localhost:7777`).

**Test method**: Direct JSON-RPC over `cairn mcp` stdio (fast, no AI model hang-ups)
for tool tests. HTTP `Invoke-RestMethod` for API tests. CLI commands for setup/bench/sync.

For the 0.5.0 release we also ship a **PowerShell scenario harness** at
`scripts/e2e.ps1` covering 20 flows (memory, context, guardrails, sessions, sync,
federation, registry, ingest, proactive, mobile companion). 67/69 assertions pass against
a fresh `docker compose up`. See `docs/E2E.md` for the full list.

## Infrastructure

| Component | Status |
|---|---|
| Docker stack (cairn + helix + minio) | Running |
| Cairn server | `http://localhost:7777` (HTTP, `CAIRN_INSECURE=1`) |
| Device token | `opencode-test` (write scope) |
| OpenCode MCP | `cairn` connected |
| `cairn.exe` | `~/.local/bin/cairn.exe` v0.5.0 |
| Workspace mount | Project mounted at `/workspace` (read-only) |

## Summary

The v0.5.0 release runs **20 e2e scenarios** (`scripts/e2e/01-*.ps1` â€¦
`20-*.ps1`, ~67 assertions, 67/69 pass) against a fresh `docker compose up`.
`cargo test --workspace` reports **330 passed + 5 ignored** for the unit
and integration suite. Both are the single source of truth for release
readiness; see `docs/E2E.md` for the scenario list and `docs/ROADMAP.md`
for the live numbers.

## Notes

- **Admin token for pool operations**: `/api/pool/contribute` requires an admin-scoped device token. Regular `write` tokens work for all personal memory/context/profile APIs.
- **Secret key consistency**: Device tokens are signed with `CAIRN_SECRET_KEY`. A token minted by one server/CLI instance is only accepted by another if they share the same secret. For Docker testing, either use the same `.env` key everywhere or create tokens inside the container.
- **Recall loose matches**: With the default `hashing` embed provider, `recall` is lexical/BM25-driven and may return similar-sounding results for nonsense queries. Switch to a semantic embed provider for stricter semantic matching.
