//! Live cost-savings metrics.
//!
//! The Cairn context engine's [`cairn_context`] and shell compressor already emit savings data
//! through the API and through the `cairn bench` tool. This module aggregates those signals
//! into a single `/api/metrics` endpoint for the dashboard:
//!
//! - **cumulative bytes / tokens served** (the sum of every read/compress payload the server
//!   has handed to agents since start)
//! - **cumulative raw bytes that *would* have been served** without compression (estimated)
//! - **hit rate / bounce rate** (the share of recall/wakeup queries the agent *did* follow up on,
//!   approximated via access_count > 0 in the memory engine)
//! - **total memories, total checkpoints** (the headline trust counters)
//!
//! The numbers are best-effort and intentionally cheap --- no on-the-fly recomputation across
//! millions of records. The point is "did the user's token spend go down?" --- a running tally
//! updated on every read.
