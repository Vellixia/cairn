//! Server-Sent Events (SSE) broker for real-time dashboard updates.
//!
//! The Cairn dashboard is a static Next.js export; pushing real-time state to it over WebSocket
//! would mean adding a second protocol. SSE is one-way (server -> browser), native to every
//! browser via [`EventSource`], and auto-reconnects --- exactly what the Overview/Audit pages
//! need to replace their 5 s polling.
//!
//! ## Event broker
//! [`EventBroker`] is a `Send + Sync` in-process pub/sub. Every state-mutating API handler (login,
//! logout, checkpoint, rollback, memory add/edit/delete, drift event) calls [`EventBroker::publish`]
//! after the operation succeeds. Subscribers (the `/api/events` SSE handler) get a
//! `tokio::sync::broadcast` receiver and stream events as they arrive.
//!
//! ## Replay (`Last-Event-ID`)
//! Each event has a monotonically increasing `id` (allocated by the store's audit backend --- same
//! source the audit log uses, so audit + live are consistent). On reconnect, the browser sends
//! `Last-Event-ID: <id>` and we replay anything newer from durable storage before resuming the
//! live stream.
