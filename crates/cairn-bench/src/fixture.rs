//! Hand-built fixture sets shaped after LongMemEval / LoCoMo.
//!
//! We deliberately do NOT redistribute the upstream LongMemEval or LoCoMo
//! datasets. They are large (10k+ dialogs) and have redistribution
//! restrictions. Instead, we capture the *shape* of those benchmarks - a
//! handful of multi-session dialogs with entity-resolution and temporal
//! questions - so the harness has something reproducible to run.
//!
//! Numbers published in `docs/testing/benchmarks.md` are from these fixtures. For
//! cross-comparison with published agentmemory numbers, run the upstream
//! benchmarks manually against this harness (instructions in benchmarks.md).
